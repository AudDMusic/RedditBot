# Music recognition bot for Reddit

[u/auddbot](https://www.reddit.com/user/auddbot) identifies music on Reddit.

When someone mentions it or writes a question like "what's the song", it sends URL of the video (or livestream) to the AudD's [Music Recognition API](https://audd.io).

Note that the code currently needs some cleaning up and doesn't follow the best practices.

You can [support the bot on Patreon](https://patreon.com/audd).
